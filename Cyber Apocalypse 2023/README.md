# Cyber Apocalypse 2023

This is the very first CTF event that I ever competed in, with minimal knowledge of how the type of challenges faced and how they work as a whole.

It is fair to say that I will definitely be completing more of these in the future!

Below is the contents page for each challenge, each folder contains my solution to the challenge and also (were applicable) some research I completed that explains how the vulnerabilities I exploited could be remediated (should these have been systems in the real world)
