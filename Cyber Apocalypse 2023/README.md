# Cyber Apocalypse 2023

This is the very first CTF event that I ever competed in, with minimal knowledge of how the type of challenges faced and how they work as a whole.

It is fair to say that I will definitely be completing more of these in the future!

Below is the contents page for each challenge, each folder contains my solution to the challenge and also a document that shows some research I completed that should hopefully go some way to avoiding these issues (should these have been systems in the real world)
