I was provided with a number of .gbr files as a part of this challenge.

This was a file type I had never seen before in my life, however a quick trip to my good friend Google showed me that this was a file type that is used store Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) and therefore I will need to find a way to open these files and view their contents. 

Looking online I found the following site that allowed me to view these files online.

A quick test with the first in the series of file presented with what appears to be first part of the flag for this challenge. Now that I know the flags for the challenge are hidden in the files, I simply need to open each file to search for the other half of this flag.

Reviewing the rest of the files I was greeted with the other half of the flag!
