# Reconfiguration

This was the first Machine Learning challenge and was certainly the first event I'd heard of that had such a group of challenges.

Reviewing the description of the challenge it was mentioned that a scatter graph had been used in order to view a large number of data points, I made a note of this for later.

Downloading the files for the challenge, I was given a CSV file and an OWS file, as I did not know much about the OWS file I decided to first look at the CSV file.

Reviewing this I could see that there was a massive number of data points within the file. There was so many in fact that it would be useful viewing these within Excel, potentially within a scatter graph?

I opened the CSV file in Excel and was greeted with a wall of numbers, I decided it would be best get this data put into a scatter graph and see if there was any correlation or anything of use there.

Inputting everything into the scatter graph, I was greeted with the above flag for the challenge!
