# Alien Cradle

This was the second challenge in the forensics category.

This challenge provided me with a '.ps1' file, for the uninitiated this is a file type that is used by Powershell. Before opening the file on a Windows device I decided to attempt to open the file within the Kali linux VM i was running. To my surprise, this was not only possible but actually contained the flag for the challenge printed in plaintext (seperated by a number of '+' statements)
